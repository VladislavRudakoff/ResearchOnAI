## TASK

Write a python function that receives the following JSON as input and enters data from it into the Google Sheet.

{
    'date': '31-05-2024',
    'revenue': 90000,
    'person' : 'User1',
    'expensesList': [30000, 14000, 10000, 2000, 15000],
    'expensesDescList': [ 'Ключи', 'Ключи2', 'Счет за такси', 'Клей, пластины', 'Провод 40м'],
    'expensesTypeList': ['Закупки', 'Закупки', 'Расходы', 'Ремонт', 'Ремонт']
}

There is a date in JSON, you can use it to determine the month.
The data is entered into a list with the name of the month. If such a list does not exist yet, then you need to create a list with a new month inside the sheet.

The list should have the following columns (the first rows are used as headings):
A1: Дата расхода,  
B1: сумма расхода, 
C1: описание расхода,  
D1: тип расхода, 
E1: кто внес данные

G1: Дата выручки
H1: Сумма выручки
I1: Кто внес данные

Please separate expenses and profits with a blank column.
Please sort expenses by date, including those already listed in Google sheet list.
Please sort earnings by date, including those already listed in Google sheet list.
